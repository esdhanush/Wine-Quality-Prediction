# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly a Random Forest Classifier, this project predicts whether a given wine can be classified as good or bad quality.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset containing physicochemical properties of red wine samples is obtained.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values, outliers, and categorical variables are handled. Data is split into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected to train the Random Forest Classifier.
4. **Model Training:** The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training set.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search or random search is performed to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Classifier.
7. **Prediction:** The final model is used to predict the quality of red wine samples.
